A book on engineering as it relates to computation and control software.
My interest in writing this book stemmed from an early morning conversation in the offices of MPO.
It went something like this:
    ...<impromptu progress report banter>...
    "...because we need to follow basic engineering principles."
    Matt, the software guy, looked up with a grin, "what are these basic engineering principles?"
    "Well..."

What happened then was an extemporaneous interview of the few people who were daft enough to work so early as to what these basic principles were.
This book is a brain-dump fed by the fruit of that conversation.

The most fascinating element of this is that all engineers have some inkling of these mysterious _principles_ but can't elucidate them.
Software developers are often beholden to a subset of these _principles_ but lack engineering rigor.

A friend would sum it up as the difference between **doing** and **knowing**.
But I don't think its that simple.
We see people do things all the time, what we want is to do them correctly and efficiently.
If I may invoke a worn idiom: you can have it correct, on time, or under budget - pick two of the three.
