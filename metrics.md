# Metrics
## Measuring the outputs of an engineering effort.

It is commonly said that the bean-counters must pick two of these three: be on budget, be on time, be on spec.
...or some variant thereof.
Basing every engineering effort should be a minimum standard at which the product is "done".
Achieving the [mythical] "done" status take money, time, and precision.
None of these should be sacrificed.
However, some may be strictly budgeted or capped based on non-engineering needs in a project.

The effect of restricting money, time, and precision are limitations in the following product metrics:
- Performance
- Price
- Polish


## Performance


## Price


## Polish
We used to say, "you can't polish a turd, but you can roll it in glitter."
It goes without saying that beauty is vain but elegance is timeless.
There are certain pieces, certain controls, certain systems that are indelible in the minds of their builders and users.


## Gooder
It is necessary to establish [beforehand] when you have attained a _useable_ state of a product.
It is more difficult to determine when, once a product is useable, you have crossed from refinement into enhancement
