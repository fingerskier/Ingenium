# Vision, Mission, and Work

## Vision
A statement laying out a long-term and/or over-arching goal.
Visions are often, necessarily general and even unattainable - laying out a path.

## Mission
A statement laying out the means by which a vision might be attained.
Missions are finite and either define or imply goals.

## Work


## Perspicacity
Penetrating discernment and keen perception.
