# Testing

## The Iterative Paradigm

The natural response to a failure at some phase of a process is retribution.
This is foolish.
If we regularly fail to foresee failure points then we are inept.
If we attempt to disallow failures then we are petrified.
If we have no prescribed response to failure then we are destined to propogate them.

The proper response to failures must be decided in advance.
Most importantly, it must be understood that iterating through a problem is a necessary part of design:

- Identify the problem
- Define the success <- this is the test
- Pass the test
- Evaluate
    - document everything at every step
    - iterate at any time
