# Process

Ask a roomful of engineers: "what are the basic engineering principles?" and you shall have your fill of blank stares and half-heartedness.

The basic principles that govern designing stuff are to be gleaned from masses of low-level engineering learning rather than simply handed over.


## Everything's a Process

Creating a thing is as simple as:

1. Design it
2. Prototype it
3. Manufacture it

But each of these defines yet another process.


## The Hierarchical Paradigm

Consider that design of a widget that begins with thought, which causes ink to be spilt upon a napkin, which <bleep-bloop> becomes a 3D animated model of the widget.

Defining exactly what comprises the <bleep-bloop> process really is as simple as breaking it down into actions and breaking those down in turn until we are left with a _roughly_ ordered list of stuff to do.

The problem with this understanding is two-fold:

1. A process that is sufficiently detailed is not extensible to other designs.
2. We cannot assume things to be always be correct the first time.

The first concern is addressed by having people who understand the bigger picture and are able to conform a process to facilitate a gifted team to work toward the main goal.
The people are often know as managers.
Unfortunately, not all people entitled __manager__ actual do this.

The second concern is addressed simply by accepting it as unavoidable.
In fact, in the [testing](testing) section I will make the case that it is a necessity.
